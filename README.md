## Reflection
🤔 Why I built it: I'm an NFT enthusiast since 2021. According to Etherscan I have made 750+ transactions so far and have bought countless NFTs on all the major NFT trading platforms. 
💆‍♀️ Challenges I Faced: This is my first time integrating crypto wallet as a authentication method to React app. After some research, I decided to go with the RainbowKit library due to their well-written documentation and built-in responsiveness. There is a learning curve to configure the code but once it's setup, the login experience feels so much smoother than the traditional email + password method.
👏 What went well: I treated this project as a mini-hackathon, It only took me 24 hours to put it together from scratch, and I was able to deliver with speed while maintaining the best practices of creating separate branches for every new feature, writing pull requests, and making meaningful commits regularly.
